    "Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "Priority Queues are abstract Data Structures. What this means is that they can be implemented with other forms of data structures like arrays for example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our main goal in priority queues to to bring something of a high priority or a low priority for us into the first index so that we can access it easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, for example, if we want to find the largest elemment in a priority queue, we can keep sorting the list and get the last element of the list everytime.\n",
    "\n",
    "This process will be computationally expensive becuase it will require us to sort in O(nlogn) time complexity. \n",
    "\n",
    "But the best part about implementing priority queues with Maxheaps in this case is that to get the max element from a maxHeap, it will take us constant time. And to heapify the maxHeap(that is both after insering and deleting a node from the heap), \n",
    "\n",
    "it will take us O(logn). This is such a nice way of reducing the tie complexity as compared to inmplementing priority queues with arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now lets talk about the worst and average case time complexities of a heap(in this case, priority queues implemented in MaxHeap)\n",
    "\n",
    "Worst case: \n",
    "\n",
    "time for inserting --> O(logn)\n",
    "\n",
    "time for deleting max element --> O(logn)\n",
    "\n",
    "space complexity --> (n) as we will be creating a new heap to store the values\n",
    "\n",
    "time to find the max element and pop --> O(1)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Average case:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "time for inserting --> O(1)\n",
    "\n",
    "time for deleting max element --> O(logn) becuase we still need to bring element from the leaf of the tree to the root in logn depth\n",
    "\n",
    "space comlexity --> O(n)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "When I think about the overall time complexity, i am considering three main componenets.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first one is the forloop that will go through each of the tasks in the list(where each task being the instance of the TaskScheduler Class)\n",
    "\n",
    "Then for each of these class, we call the methods in the the TaskScheduler class. In the TaskScheduler class, the worst time it will take is \n",
    "\n",
    "when I have a multitasking task becuase I will have to loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "So these two steps alone gave me O(n^2). But there is a third step, and that is finding the prioritized element from the heap, and that would take logn\n",
    "\n",

    "I believe my shedule is efficient becuase it considers different attributes into consideration. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "On top of the list of taska and the duration, my schedule also considers the dependacy and the taskImportance. \n",
    "\n",
    "These two are important becuase the importance of one task might not be as important as the other\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if I have an assignment deadline, then playing basket ball will not be that important. So the assignment deadline will have a taskImportance value that is higher.\n",
    "\n",
    "This will help me make the number larger and bring it to the first index of the MaxHeap. And by that, I will be able to pop it easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, I make a dependancy list which indicates how one action depends on the other. For example, waking up might not depend on anyothe activity while attending class will depend on finishing the preclass work. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "So my schedule considers all these attributes and I believe it is robust as a schedule. \n",

    "And I am planning to use it for my personal use as the algorithm actually helped me sort out a long list of tasks into a short ordered output. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, as I mentioned above, the attributes I have considered for my Scheduler made it robust in identifying and prioritizing the tasks with higher taskImportance among other factros such us dependancy(and duration of two multitaking tasks)\n",
